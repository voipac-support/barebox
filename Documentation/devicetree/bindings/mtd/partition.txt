Representing flash partitions in devicetree

In addition to the upstream binding, another property is added:

Optional properties:
- partuuid : The partition UUID for this partition.


Examples:

flash@0 {
	partitions {
		compatible = "fixed-partitions";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		state_part: state {
			partuuid = "16367da7-c518-499f-9aad-e1f366692365";
		};
	};
};
