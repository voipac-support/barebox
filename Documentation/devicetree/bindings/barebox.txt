barebox specific devicetree bindings
====================================

barebox uses some barebox specific devicetree bindings. All of these
are under the /chosen/ hierarchy in the devicetree.

The bindings have the form of a device with regular 'compatible' properties.
drivers matching these devices do not handle physical devices but instead
influence / configure certain behaviours of barebox like the place where to
find the persistent environment.
